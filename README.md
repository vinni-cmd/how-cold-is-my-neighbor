Project 3: React, with either API or persistence

Objective:

To show an understanding of core React concepts (ie. state, props, components), working with external or third-party data sources (ie. APIs / Firebase), error handling and UI design.

Description

For this project, you will use the React library to create an interactive application. This will call on everything you have learned up to now!

Your data should either come from an API or be stored in Firebase.
